# Methodology
<b> Description: </b> Novel techniques have shown Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can be used to highlight burial sites. Given the usefulness of LiDAR in the literature, weâ€™re using this data to find unmarked graves in Jacksonville.

<b> Generally, our methodology will look as follows, and follow a RAG Methodology structure</b>
1. Understand what the elevation is - in Jacksonville, 
2. Account for density of agriculture
3. An account of historical churches/buildings

## RAG Methodology 
The Red-Amber-Green prioritization system is an approach that has been utilized in searches for graves and other buried objects for (decades)[https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsl/books/edited-volume/1746/chapter-abstract/107630054/Geomorphological-and-geoforensic-interpretation-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext]. 


### Rag Table
|GIS-Based RAG Factor|Red Criterion|Amber Criterion|Green Criterion|Description|
|--------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
|Elevation|Elevation within 5th percentile|Elevation within 10th percentile|Elevation greater than 10th percentile|By using the elevation from LiDAR data we can filter to points with the lowest elev|
|Geomorpons|Slope/Foot Slope| Slope/Flat|Peak|Creating landforms called geomorphs can allow us to visualize microslopes in the ground. This may work better in a place like Florida where elevation changes are less drastic|
|Vegetation Density|Well-spaced trees/no dense vegetation|Sparsely dense vegetation|Dense vegetation|Using HLS 2 satelite data can allow us to classify vegetation|
|Historical Context|Within x feet of a church|Within x yards of a church|Within x miles of a church|The presence of a nearby church or heritage site may be indicative of a burial site in the area|
