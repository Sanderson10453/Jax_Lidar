# Methodology
<b> Description: </b> Novel techniques have shown Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can be used to highlight burial sites. Given the usefulness of LiDAR in the literature, weâ€™re using this data to find unmarked graves in Jacksonville.

<b> Generally, our methodology will look as follows, and follow a RAG Methodology structure</b>
1. Understand what the elevation is - in Jacksonville, 
2. Account for density of agriculture
3. An account of historical churches/buildings

The Red-Amber-Green prioritization system is an approach that has been utilized in searches for graves and other buried objects for (decades)[https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsl/books/edited-volume/1746/chapter-abstract/107630054/Geomorphological-and-geoforensic-interpretation-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext].
